In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict match outcomes (home win, away win, or draw) for the English Premier League based on two seasons of match data from FBref.com. The project involved extensive exploratory data analysis, including assessing the impact of team formations, audience attendance, and key match events like set-pieces on match results.

Key Highlights:

Performed a chi-square test to confirm that team formations significantly influence match outcomes, with the 4-3-3 formation being the most successful.
Conducted correlation analysis to identify that shots attempted, shots on target, and corners contribute most to goal-scoring.
Engineered key features like recent team form, home win percentages, and head-to-head performance to enhance predictive power.
Trained Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models, using 10-fold cross-validation to classify match outcomes.
Achieved over 60% accuracy with Logistic Regression for home and away wins, while KNN performed well in classifying home wins (~82%) and away wins (~71%).
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in sports analytics, providing tactical insights and identifying patterns that can be valuable for teams, analysts, and bettors.
